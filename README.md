This project is for a coding challenge for UnifyID. I chose to use the random numbers generated from Random.org to generate an RSA key pair. It is currently configured to have the random numbers be from a list of 75 random numbers in a range from 25 to 7500, but can easily be configured to any set of numbers or (with a couple of lines of code) read from command line arguments.
